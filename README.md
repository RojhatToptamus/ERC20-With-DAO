# Basic ERC20 Token Contract with a Governor Contract
Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat run --network rinkeby scripts/1_deploy_token.js
npx hardhat run --network rinkeby scripts/3_deploy_governor.js
npx hardhat console --network rinkeby
const MyGovernor = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory('MyGovernor');
const myGovernor = MyGovernor.attach([Deployed Governor Contract Address]);
const MyToken = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory('MyToken');
const myToken = MyToken.attach([Deployed Token Contract Addreess]);

let accounts = await ethers.getSigner():

Task 1: Mint Some Tokens for voting power and delegate voting power

await myToken.mintToken(accounts[0].address, ethers.utils.parseUnits('1.0', 'ether'));
await myGovernor.delegates(accounts[0].address); // returns delegated accounts
await myGovernor.delegate(accounts[0].address) // delegate to yourself
await myToken.transferOwnership([Governor Contract Address]); // transfer token contract ownership to the governor

Task 2: Create a proposal

const receiverAddress = '0x2F9f3505CbXXXXX'; // Type one of your accounts, minted tokens will be sent by governor contract
const transferCalldata = myToken.interface.encodeFunctionData('mintToken', [receiverAddress,12]); // mint 12 wei to receiver address
let result = await myGovernor.createProposal(['token contract address'],[0], [transferCalldata], 'Mint 12 wei to  receiver address',);
let receiptValue = await result.wait();
console.log(receiptValue.events.filter((x) => {return x.event == "ProposalCreated"})); // print ProposalCreated event on console this will return the proposal id
const pID = ethers.BigNumber.from([type the proposal id]);
await myGovernor.state(pID); // get proposal state 0:pending 1:Active 2: Cancelled 3:Defeated 4:Succeeded

Task 3: Cast Vote

myGovernor.castVote(pID, '1'); // 0: abstain 1: Support 2: Against

Task 4: Execute Proposal

const descriptionHash = ethers.utils.id('Mint 12 wei to  receiver address');
await myGovernor.executeProposal(pID,[token contract address],[0],[transferCalldata],descriptionHash);
